# Third-Party Notices

This file records third-party software identified in the project's current
development configuration. It is an inventory, not legal advice or a
certification that a particular source or binary distribution satisfies every
license obligation.

## Scope of this inventory

The versions below reflect the maintainer's development setup: Qt 6.8.0 for
MSVC 2022 and MuPDF 1.26.10 from vcpkg using the `x64-windows-static-md`
triplet. The vcpkg component versions were read from that local installation.
Other Qt installations, vcpkg baselines, features, or triplets can produce a
different dependency set and must be checked separately.

The source repository does not include Qt or MuPDF binaries. The application
links to Qt dynamically and links MuPDF statically when built with the
configuration above. A public source repository and a distributed executable
are different distribution cases; these notices alone do not satisfy all
requirements for distributing a binary.

## Qt

- Project: [Qt](https://www.qt.io/)
- Development version and kit: Qt 6.8.0, MSVC 2022, 64-bit.
- CMake components requested by this project: Widgets, Pdf, and PdfWidgets
  (with their Qt dependencies).
- The packaging run's `windeployqt` output also selected Qt Core, Gui, Network,
  Svg, and Widgets runtime libraries and plugins. The exact deployed set can
  vary with the Qt installation and build.
- The maintainer reports using the LGPL-3.0 option. Confirm the selected terms
  and eligibility for the exact installed Qt modules and package before
  distributing the application.
- License texts in this repository: `licenses/LGPL-3.0.txt` and
  `licenses/GPL-3.0.txt`.
- General licensing information:
  [Qt licensing](https://www.qt.io/licensing/).

### Qt PDF and PDFium

Qt PDF uses PDFium and includes third-party components associated with the
Chromium project. Their licenses and required notices are separate from Qt's
own license and can vary with the exact Qt PDF source and binary package.
Consult the documentation for the version being used:

- [Qt PDF licensing](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.8/qtpdf-licensing.html)
- [PDFium notices in Qt PDF 6.8](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.8/qtpdf-3rdparty-pdfium.html)
- [Chromium-project notices in Qt PDF 6.8](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.8/qtpdf-3rdparty-the-chromium-project.html)
- [Qt 6.8.0 source archive](https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/6.8/6.8.0/)

The project has not independently inventoried every PDFium/Chromium component
in the installed Qt 6.8.0 package or copied that package's complete notice set
into this repository. This is an explicit unresolved item for any binary
release: inspect the exact Qt 6.8.0 package's accompanying notices and include
all notices and license texts required for that package. Do not treat the
upstream documentation links alone as proof that a release archive is complete.

## MuPDF and vcpkg-built dependencies

MuPDF is provided by [Artifex Software](https://mupdf.com/).
The development build uses MuPDF 1.26.10, statically linked from the vcpkg
`x64-windows-static-md` triplet. The vcpkg-installed copyright and license
notices for MuPDF and the dependencies listed below are kept in
`licenses/vcpkg/`.

| Component | Installed version | License identified in the installed package | Notice file |
|---|---:|---|---|
| MuPDF | 1.26.10 | GNU AGPL v3.0 only | `licenses/vcpkg/libmupdf-copyright.txt`; license text: `licenses/AGPL-3.0.txt` |
| FreeType | 2.14.3 | FreeType License (FTL) or GPL-2.0-or-later | `licenses/vcpkg/freetype-copyright.txt` |
| Gumbo | 0.14.1 | Apache License 2.0 | `licenses/vcpkg/gumbo-copyright.txt` |
| HarfBuzz | 14.5.1 | MIT-family licenses; see the included notice for component-specific terms | `licenses/vcpkg/harfbuzz-copyright.txt` |
| jbig2dec | 0.20 | GNU AGPL v3.0 | `licenses/vcpkg/jbig2dec-copyright.txt`; license text: `licenses/AGPL-3.0.txt` |
| libjpeg-turbo | 3.2.0 | BSD 3-Clause and Independent JPEG Group (IJG) license terms | `licenses/vcpkg/libjpeg-turbo-copyright.txt` |
| OpenJPEG | 2.5.4 | BSD 2-Clause | `licenses/vcpkg/openjpeg-copyright.txt` |
| zlib | 1.3.2 | zlib license | `licenses/vcpkg/zlib-copyright.txt` |
| Brotli | 1.2.0 | MIT | `licenses/vcpkg/brotli-copyright.txt` |
| bzip2 | 1.0.8 | bzip2 license | `licenses/vcpkg/bzip2-copyright.txt` |
| libpng | 1.6.59 | libpng License version 2 | `licenses/vcpkg/libpng-copyright.txt` |
| libspng | 0.7.4 | BSD 2-Clause and libpng License version 2 | `licenses/vcpkg/libspng-copyright.txt` |

Some listed libraries are transitive dependencies of other libraries in the
MuPDF build. The table records the installed package set, not a claim that the
application calls each library directly. The accompanying copyright files
contain the applicable notices and, where supplied by vcpkg, license text.

The installed MuPDF port metadata reports AGPL-3.0-only. Static linking is
therefore a material release consideration. Before distributing a binary,
determine and meet the obligations that apply to the exact MuPDF build and
combined application, including any required corresponding source and build
materials. The packaging script does not provide those materials. Obtain legal
advice if you need a determination of how the license applies to this project.

## Build and packaging tools

The development workflow uses CMake, Visual Studio/MSVC, and vcpkg. The package
manager and build tools are not linked into the application by this project.
The vcpkg CMake helper ports and Meson are build-time dependencies in the
installed vcpkg environment; they are not listed above as application runtime
components. Re-check the toolchain's own terms if redistributing any of those
tools.

## Project files and assets

The project's own source code is licensed under the GNU AGPL v3.0; see
`LICENSE`. The application icon artwork (`resources/pdfappicon.png` and
`resources/pdfappicon.ico`) is project artwork supplied by the maintainer and
is not identified here as third-party material.

## Before publishing or releasing

- For a source-only repository, keep this inventory and the referenced license
  texts with the project. This does not determine whether every aspect of a
  source publication complies with every applicable license.
- Before distributing an executable, create and review a dependency inventory
  for the exact build, include all required notices and license texts, and
  address the applicable obligations for the dynamically linked Qt libraries,
  Qt PDF's PDFium/Chromium components, and statically linked MuPDF and its
  dependencies.
- Recheck this file whenever Qt, vcpkg, MuPDF, the triplet, or enabled features
  change. Do not rely on this development-build snapshot as a release SBOM.
